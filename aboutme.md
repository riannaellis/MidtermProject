### My Favorite Memory:
One of my favorite memories was when I visited the Japanese Friendship Garden   
in San Diego, California. I went there last summer with two of my friends. The  
weather was super beautiful, and I loved seeing all of the plants. There was a  
path that led us downhill, which meant that when we reached the bottom and looked  
up, we could only see nature around us instead of the city. It was a super unique,  
immersive experience that I will never forget!
